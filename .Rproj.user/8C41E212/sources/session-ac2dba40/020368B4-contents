### Q1a.

What are the mean, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of `SCORE` for each `GRADE` of restaurants?

*Answer*:
```{r}
q1a <- restaurant |> 
  group_by(GRADE) |> 
  skim()


```

<br><br>

### Q1b.

- How many restaurants with a `GRADE` of `A` are there in each `BORO` in NYC?

*Answer*:
```{r}
q1b <- restaurant |> 
  filter(GRADE == 'A') |> 
  count(BORO)


```

<br>

### Q1c.

- Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the distribution of `SCORE` varies by `GRADE` and `CRITICAL FLAG`.



*Answer*:
```{r}
# Boxplot
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = SCORE, y = GRADE, fill = GRADE),
               show.legend = F) +
  facet_grid( `CRITICAL FLAG` ~ . )

#Surprisingly, critical restaurants have a higher average score
```

<br><br>

### Q1d.

Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the proportion of `CRITICAL FLAG` varies by `GRADE` and `BORO`.


*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = `CRITICAL FLAG`,
               x = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +
  facet_grid( GRADE ~ BORO )
#Distribution across grade a is very similar. for grade b staten island is the most critical. for grade c bronx is most critical
```

<br><br>

### Q1e.
- Calculate the proportion of restaurants that had violation related to `contamination` or `mice` in each `BORO`.

*Answer*:
```{r}
q1e <- restaurant |> 
  mutate(`VIOLATION DESCRIPTION` = str_to_lower(`VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`),
         contamination_mice = ifelse(str_detect(`VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`, 'contamination') | 
                                       str_detect(`VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`, 'mice'), 
                                     T, F) ) |> 
  group_by(BORO) |> 
  summarise(n = n(),
            n_contamination_mice = sum(contamination_mice),
            prop = 100 * n_contamination_mice / n)

#Manhattan had the highest mouse contamination by far while staten island had the least.
```

<br><br>


### Q1f.

-   Find the 3 most common names of restaurants (`DBA`) in each `BORO`.
-   Overall, which `DBA` value is most common in NYC?


*Answer*:
```{r}
q1f <- restaurant %>% 
  select(DBA, BORO) %>% 
  group_by(BORO, DBA) %>% 
  mutate(ranking = dense_rank(-n)) %>% 
  arrange(BORO, ranking)
#Very confused on this one
```

<br><br>


### Q1g.

- Construct a bar chart to display the top 10 names of restaurants (`DBA`) sortetd by the frequency of each name within their respective borough (`BORO`).


*Answer*:
```{r}
top10 <- q1f_ |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  slice_max(n, n = 10)

q1g <- restaurant |> 
  filter(DBA %in% top10$DBA)

ggplot(q1g, aes(y = DBA, fill = DBA)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = F) +
  facet_wrap(BORO ~ .)
```

<br><br>


### Q1h
What is your GitHub username?


*Answer*:
```{r}
atabst
```
